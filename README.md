# Gendered-Lyrics
-Description: A repository hosting files for webscrapping and grouping the lyrics of the top artist's songs and using that data to create an interactive website for seeing trends. Allows you to visualize the different words used by male and female artists from the top songs in the world

- Additional Requirements: Will need to add the file "node_modules" seperately in order to run the React.JS website locally. 
```npm install --save react``` 
```npm install canvasjs ```
```npm install --save-dev json-loader```

- What is used: This repository uses Python Juypter Notebooks on the back-end along with React.JS, HTML, and CSS on the front-end.

- Website: http://reactweb2-300805.appspot.com/ (deployed on Google Cloud Platform)
