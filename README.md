# Gendered-Lyrics
A repository hosting files for webscrapping and grouping the lyrics of the top artist's songs and using that data to create an interactive website for seeing trends. Allows you to visualize the different words used by male and female artists from the top songs in the world

Will need to add the file "node_modules" seperately in order to run the React.JS website locally.

This repository uses Python Juypter Notebooks along with React.JS, HTML, and CSS on the front end.
